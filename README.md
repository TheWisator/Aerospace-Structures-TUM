Task 1: Compute the master stiffness matrix of the system, using the interpretation of entries
in the stiffness matrix as “displacement influence coefficients \n
Task 2: Specify the master stiffness equation. Which are the unknowns? Implement the master stiffness equation with Matlab / Python. \n
Task 3: For stiffness values of 𝑘1 = 50, 𝑘2 = 75 compute displacements 𝑢𝑥 and 𝑢𝑦 at the free node for given forces 𝐹𝑥 = 1, 𝐹𝑦 = −0.8. Compute the forces in the truss members and the support reactions. Use your Matlab / Python script to solve for the displacements and forces.\n
Task 4: The angles 𝜑1 and 𝜑2 are varied simultaneously from 90° to 0° (𝜑1 = 𝜑2). Using your Matlab / Python script, evaluate the displacements at intervals of 10°. The values of 𝐹𝑥 , 𝐹𝑦 , 𝑘1 and 𝑘2 are the same as in Task 3. Plot the change in displacement 𝑢𝑦 over the angle 𝜑1. How does the determinant of the stiffness matrix change? Implement det(K) as well as its Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors and comment on the changes appearing with the changing angles
